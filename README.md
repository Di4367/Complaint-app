# Complaint-app
Unmute is a student complaint and feedback management app developed specifically for NMIMS Shirpur campus. The app is designed to bridge the communication gap between students and campus administration by offering a structured platform to report issues and provide suggestions. Students can submit complaints under various categories such as Academic, Hostel, Mess/Food, Infrastructure, and General concerns. With features like image uploads, real-time status tracking, and optional anonymous submission, Unmute ensures a user-friendly and transparent experience. The app not only helps in addressing individual problems efficiently but also encourages collective improvements across campus. Built with a smooth pastel theme and clean interface, Unmute aims to make the process of raising concerns calm, easy, and impactful—ultimately fostering a more responsive, inclusive, and student-centric environment.

Objective of Project: Create a centralized, user-friendly digital platform that empowers NMIMS Shirpur students to raise complaints, give suggestions, and receive timely resolutions—ensuring a transparent, responsive, and student-centric campus environment.

The UNMUTE app opens with a clean and minimal welcome screen that prominently features its logo — a muted microphone icon inside a speech bubble — along with the tagline "Unmute the silence, Fix the problems." Beneath it is a soft-colored button labeled “Get Started,” inviting users to begin their experience.
