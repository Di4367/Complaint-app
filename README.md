# Complaint-app
Unmute is a student complaint and feedback management app developed specifically for NMIMS Shirpur campus. The app is designed to bridge the communication gap between students and campus administration by offering a structured platform to report issues and provide suggestions. Students can submit complaints under various categories such as Academic, Hostel, Mess/Food, Infrastructure, and General concerns. With features like image uploads, real-time status tracking, and optional anonymous submission, Unmute ensures a user-friendly and transparent experience. The app not only helps in addressing individual problems efficiently but also encourages collective improvements across campus. Built with a smooth pastel theme and clean interface, Unmute aims to make the process of raising concerns calm, easy, and impactful—ultimately fostering a more responsive, inclusive, and student-centric environment.

Objective of Project: Create a centralized, user-friendly digital platform that empowers NMIMS Shirpur students to raise complaints, give suggestions, and receive timely resolutions—ensuring a transparent, responsive, and student-centric campus environment.

Beneath it is a soft-colored button labeled “Get Started,” inviting users to begin their experience.

The dashboard highlights a “Complaint Statistics” section that visually displays the status of complaints, categorized into Pending, In Progress, and Resolved with respective counts and color-coded icons. Below that, recent complaints are listed in neatly styled cards, each showing the issue title, time of submission, a brief description, category tag, and a “View Details” button for more information. The design uses soft pastel tones with a clean layout, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation, making it a practical tool for students to communicate campus-related problems.

At the bottom, a timeline section tracks the progress of the complaint by logging status changes with timestamps. This feature ensures transparency, improves communication, and helps users stay updated on the resolution process.
